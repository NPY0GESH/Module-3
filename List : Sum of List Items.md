# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Python’s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program

Add code here
```
lst=eval(input())
total = 0
for num in lst:
    if num%10==3:
        total += num
print("Sum=", total)
```
